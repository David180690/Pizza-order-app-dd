            After 8 years of serving bubbly, char-kissed pizza out of their home-made welded steel arch mobile wood fired
            ovens, Pizza Boys first brick and mortar home is now open!
    
            Having looked for years for the perfect place to put down roots for their business, co-owners Dave Boy
            (executive chef) and Anna Boy (general manager) found a turn of the century coal oven hidden behind a wall
            in a dark storefront at 338 Hamilton Ave, Brooklyn.
